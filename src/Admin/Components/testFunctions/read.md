# Test Function Folder

## Purpose
The `Test Function Folder` folder contains several components that were created during the development process for **testing** and **building custom modules**. These components serve as a foundation or a reference point for creating reusable modules in the future.

## Status
The components in this folder are **not directly used** in the main application. They exist as part of the development process and can be referenced or re-used as necessary during module creation.

## Usage
Although these components are not part of the active project, they were instrumental in testing and building out the logic for more complex, reusable modules.

## Future Consideration
- The folder is kept for **reference** and **experimentation**.
- You may decide to remove or modify components from this folder as the project evolves or if the logic is no longer needed.

## Notes
- The components and logic here are **raw** and may not represent the finalized version of the modules.
- Always check the main applicationâ€™s architecture before directly using any of the components from this folder.
